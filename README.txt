This is a 2d platformer game about a ball
shaped creature named Diddle. Diddle doesn't
feel appreciated by his friends and is often
made fun of for being different. However,
one day he awakes to find his friends have
been kidnapped by robots and he must save the
day. Along the way he gets various upgrades,
and has to bounce, fly, and climb from level
to level. Sometimes even returning to one he
has already beaten to solve a puzzle and
unlock something.
